# Trams

This is a trams resource for FiveM, instead of spawning the trains itself it will use SetRandomTrains(1) and let the game take care of it, to enable this in FiveM you need to call an extra native which was found by @Disquse

The resource will also take care of the doors, so while it's driving doors are closed and at the station one side of the doors is still closed. Like in GTA IV it will also show you the next upcoming station.

## Translating

There's a config.lua where you can easily change the "next station is" text, please make sure you read the comments above first. If you want to translate the station names browse to client.lua and at the top there's a big table with every station name.
